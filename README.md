HR Analytics Project📊



This project focuses on generating insights from an employee attendance dataset using Excel & Power BI.



1️⃣Objective:

To analyze employee attendance patterns and generate performance insights using Power BI and DAX.



2️⃣Tools & Techniques🛠:



➜Excel (initial dataset)

➜Power Query (data cleaning and transformation)

➜Power BI (data modeling and visualization)

➜DAX (calculated measures and logic)



3️⃣Steps Taken📈:



➜Data Cleaning

➜Imported multiple sheets from Excel.

➜Combined them using Power Query to form a unified dataset.

➜Handled inconsistencies and standardized date formats.



4️⃣Data Modeling:



➜Created relationships and optimized the data model.

➜Pivoted dates into a single structure to simplify analysis.

➜DAX Calculations:

➜Calculated employee present %.

➜Used VAR in DAX to simplify and clean complex calculations.



✅Created custom logic to calculate attendance:



➜WFH (Work From Home) counted as 1 full day.

➜HWFH (Half WFH) counted as 0.5 day.

➜New column generated to capture this adjusted presence.



✅Insights Derived:



➜Identified total present days per employee.

➜Filtered and compared WFH vs. HWFH trends.

➜Prepared visuals to highlight attendance and behavior patterns.



Found a pattern where most employees preferred WFH on Fridays, while Mondays had higher in-office attendance.



✅Key Takeaway- Felt how dax can be more efficient in creating measures.

✅Used Power Query to combine all data into a single sheet, which made filtering easier and improved the overall analysis process 

Thank you!
