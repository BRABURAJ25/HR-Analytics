# HR-Analytics

 HR Analytics Project📊
This project focuses on generating insights from an employee attendance dataset using Power BI.

Objective:
To analyze employee attendance patterns and generate performance insights using Power BI and DAX.

🛠 Tools & Techniques:
Excel (initial dataset)

Power Query (data cleaning and transformation)

Power BI (data modeling and visualization)

DAX (calculated measures and logic)

📈 Steps Taken:
Data Cleaning:

Imported multiple sheets from Excel.

Combined them using Power Query to form a unified dataset.

Handled inconsistencies and standardized date formats.

Data Modeling:

Created relationships and optimized the data model.

Pivoted dates into a single structure to simplify analysis.

DAX Calculations:

Calculated employee present %.

Used VAR in DAX to simplify and clean complex calculations.

Created custom logic to calculate attendance:

WFH (Work From Home) counted as 1 full day.

HWFH (Half WFH) counted as 0.5 day.

New column generated to capture this adjusted presence.

Insights Derived:

Identified total present days per employee.

Filtered and compared WFH vs. HWFH trends.

Prepared visuals to highlight attendance and behavior patterns.

✅Key Takeaway- Felt how dax can be more efficient in creating measures.
